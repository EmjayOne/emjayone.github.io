      "Hi, I'm Martin Junghans! I'm a professional software developer from Leipzig. My passion for computers and IT has been with me since I was a child. In 2019, I took the plunge and turned my hobby into a career. Since then, I have been exploring various aspects of the digital world with curiosity and excitement, building up my knowledge and skills in a determined and strategic way.",
      "My journey began with a degree in computer science at BA Leipzig. During this time, I was able to quickly and systematically acquire many basics. Following my curiosity, I first learned Python and got to grips with the topics of AI, data structures and algorithms. Later, I started to specialize as a front-end developer. Thanks to this shift in focus, I now have extensive knowledge of HTML, CSS, JavaScript and TypeScript. I have already applied my skills in various professional and private projects. In this context, I have also worked with various web frameworks, CSS libraries and preprocessors, build tools and test environments.",
      "I am currently expanding my knowledge of backend and dev ops. In addition, I plan to continue my education in the areas of software architecture, artificial intelligence, cyber security and virtual reality."

These effects may in extreme cases reduce the reliability and life of the equipment installed in the network or lead to unnecessary tripping operations triggered by protective devices. Controlling the CLOSE and/or OPEN switching instant (controlled switching) of circuit-breakers with the PSD can effectively reduce these loads (overvoltages and inrush currents).",
