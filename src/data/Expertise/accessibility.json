            "There are close to 8 billion people in the world. According to World Health Organization, there are over one billion people with disabilities. That is about 15 % of the population. Access to information is a human right.",
            "People are different. People are diverse. We must welcome everyone regardless of race, religion, country of origin, gender identity, sexual orientation, ability and disabilities, spoken language or age. We think that web accessibility is about abilities and disabilities. It is also about spoken languages. Is your content written in an easily understandable way for people with a different language background? Have you avoided text in images, so that all text is translatable? It is also about age. With age comes challenges. Technical challenges. Cognitive challenges. Mobility challenges.",
            "The principle that everyone should be able to use the web equally, regardless of any disability, is as important today as it was twenty years ago. People who have limited use of their arms, people who cannot hear or see well and people who process information differently, should all be able to access and use web sites and apps. Web technologies have many built in features for accessibility, and we as web developers should know them so that we do not exclude any of our users."
