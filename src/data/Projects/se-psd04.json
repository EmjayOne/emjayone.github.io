        "The PSD control unit is used to reduce increased electrodynamic and dielectric loads in the network which may be caused by normal switching of high-voltage circuit-breakers. These effects may in extreme cases reduce the reliability and life of the equipment installed in the network or lead to unnecessary tripping operations triggered by protective devices. Controlling the CLOSE and/or OPEN switching instant (controlled switching) of circuit-breakers with the PSD can effectively reduce these loads (overvoltages and inrush currents).",
